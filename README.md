# adaptive-info-rates
This repository explores how learning efficiency evolves under non-stationary cognitive states 
(e.g. sleep debt and recovery), using a simple state -space simulation.

The notebook `baseline_learning_states.ipynb` demonstrates baseline learning dynamics and includes an intervention condition in which recovery rate increases after a specified day, representing medication or external cognitive support.
Data-driven information flow under non-stationary cognitive states, with applications to education and adaptive systems.
